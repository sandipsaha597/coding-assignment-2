 * Checks if two elements overlap by a specified margin in pixels. By margin I don't mean CSS margin.
 * 
 * Overlap Algorithm
 * by rect I am referring to rectangle
 * - if rect1's left is greater than rect2's right I know for sure that they are overlapping/colliding
 * - if rect1's right is less than rect2's left I know for sure that they are overlapping/colliding
 * - if rect1's top is greater than rect2's bottom I know for sure that they are overlapping/colliding
 * - if rect1's bottom is less than rect2's top I know for sure that they are overlapping/colliding 

    now when I know when they are not overlapping/colliding, I can work on margin. I want to know if they are overlapping by a certain margin or not
    - by subtracting from right side and adding on left I made rect smaller on x-axis
    - by subtracting from bottom side and adding on top I made rect smaller on y-axis
    - so now I made the rect2 smaller that means rect1 would have to move further to reach rect2 
 * 
 * @param {Element} element1 - The first element to check.
 * @param {Element} element2 - The second element to check.
 * @param {number} [marginWidth=0] - Margin in pixels to consider overlapping in width.
 * @param {number} [marginHeight=0] - Margin in pixels to consider overlapping in height.
 * @returns {boolean} True if elements overlap by the specified margin, false otherwise.
